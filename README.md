# Game of life with Python

*Here I have implemented python CA simulation and also some basic patterns using external library*

## Install

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

## Usage

In `cellular_automaton.py` is a python implementation of CA. Set the rule, cell amount and desired number of generations
and run it as `python cellular_automaton.py`

In `patterns.py` uncomment pattern of interest and comment all others, then run `python patterns.py`
